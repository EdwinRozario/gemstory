# Gemstory
Gemstory tells the history of the Gems in your project. Its a command line tool that will read the history of the Gemfile.lock and project the output in terminal.

## Installation

    $ gem install gemstory

## Usage

Run `gemstory` in your project root folder. This will return the history of Gem upgrades of the project.

#### Options

A single Gem name can be passed as an option. This will return detailed information about the Gem's history, commits and authors.

`gemstory rails`

Or multiple Gems can be passed as options so that history can be compared.

`gemstory rails thin`

## Development

More CLI options are under construction. Output can be a json file or an HTML file in the future.
